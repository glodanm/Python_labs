Task for lab:
Create a class "Helicopter" which contains fields:
- maximum lifting weight

Three additional fields that best describe this class
Designer (with default values)
Destructor
Method that returns a tape representation of a class (__str __ ())
Static field
Static method that returns the value of a static field
In the main () method, identify 3 objects of type from the task 
(due to the transfer of different numbers of parameters) 
and display information about them using the method from step 4 in the console
The developed code should be flooded into the hit repository as a pull request! 
The repository should have a README and .gitignore file.

How to launch the program:
	1. Install Python3
	2. Download the code files into one folder
	3. Being in that folder in CMD write "python main.py"
